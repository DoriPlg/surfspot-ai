The sea has ever been troublesome to forecast, the coastline evermore so.
For many surfers around the world, choosing what beach to go to when the waves are hitting can make or break a session.
That is why we developed a tool based on Machine Learning to better forecast which beach will "supply the goods" for a given day.

If you want to support us, please help by going surfing, and filling out our [data form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9Wm6orK7bCf7iOgTsoAxMu30My_7urWBKoy6a5DuyB4w_bw/viewform) - that way we can improve our forecasting!
